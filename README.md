# BuilderHeroes (Temporary name)
## 2D fantasy survival

It is a 2d survival game where we create a character choosing from many known races such as humans, elves or orcs, then personalizing our hero by choosing gender, bloodline, deity or skills to finally move to a new world where everything is crazy and unknown.
Ultimately, the game will be multiplayer.
